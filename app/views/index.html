    <h1>Delegated Access</h1>

    <p>Nominated Access - This scenario is where one competent adult wants to share access to some/all of their health data with another competent adult. 
          Both parties will need to have an NHS login.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Partner service usability is just as important as DA journey</li>
            <li>Users have different mental models around how to add a delegate - many would share login credentials</li>
            <li>Once users found the area to add a delegate, they were more confident with adding another one</li>
            <li>Users want to directly control who has access on their behalf</li>
            <li>Users may need to be sign-posted to add a person in different parts of the partner service</li>

        <h3>Design Challenges (5)</h3>
          <ul>

            <p>Added a new design for relationship selection. Removed reference to legal name and legal relationship.
            Changed the myHealth colour scheme to be green. Added ability to add the primary user at the start of the flow.
